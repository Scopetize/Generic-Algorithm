# Problem: Solving a Mathematical Optimization Problem

This code aims to solve a mathematical optimization problem by finding the best solution that minimizes a given objective function. The objective function, defined as `problem(x, y, z)`, combines multiple variables (`x`, `y`, `z`) in a specific mathematical expression.

# Solution: Genetic Algorithm Optimization

To solve the optimization problem, we employ a genetic algorithm technique. Here's an overview of how it works:

1. Initialization: We start by generating an initial population of 10 solutions (`solutions`). Each solution consists of randomly assigned values for `x`, `y`, and `z` within a specified range.

2. Evaluation: The fitness of each solution is calculated using the objective function. The fitness score represents how well a solution performs, with a higher score indicating a better solution. If the objective function evaluates to 0, the fitness score is set to a high value (`9999999`) to prioritize that solution.

3. Iterative Improvement: The genetic algorithm iterates for a fixed number of generations (100 in this case). In each generation, the following steps are performed:

   a. Ranking: The solutions are sorted based on their fitness scores in descending order.

   b. Selection: The top-performing solutions (the best 100) are selected to form the next generation (`bestsolutions`).

   c. Reproduction: From the selected solutions, a new population (`newGen`) is generated by combining and mutating elements.

   d. Update: The new population becomes the current population (`solutions`), and the process repeats for the next generation.

4. Visualization: After the genetic algorithm completes, the best solution from each generation is printed, allowing us to track the progress of finding the optimal solution. Additionally, two plots are generated using Matplotlib: one displaying the elements from the best solutions and another showing the evolution of the entire population over generations.

# Conclusion

By employing a genetic algorithm optimization approach, this code demonstrates an iterative process of generating and improving solutions to solve a mathematical optimization problem. The algorithm aims to find the best solution that minimizes the objective function. Visualization tools such as printing the best solution in each generation and creating plots aid in understanding the progress and outcome of the optimization process.
